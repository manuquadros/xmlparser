Both were similar as far as biomass yield is concerned. Cell-linked cholesterol oxidase was extracted with Triton X-114, and this detergent was also used for purification and concentration, following temperature-induced detergent phase separation. Triton X-114 was utilized to purify and to concentrate the cell-linked and the extracellular enzyme. Cholesterol oxidase was found mainly in the resulting detergent-rich phase. When Triton X-114 concentration was set to 6% w/v the extracellular, but not the cell-extracted enzyme, underwent a 3.4-fold activation after the phase separation process. This result is interpreted in the light of interconvertible forms of the enzyme that do not seem to be in equilibrium. Fermentation yielded 360 U/ml (672 U/ml after activation), 36% of which was extracellular (65% after activation). The Triton X-114 phase separation step yielded 11.6-fold purification and 20.3-fold concentration.</p>         </sec>         <sec>           <title>Conclusions</title>           <p>The results of this work may make attractive and cost-effective the implementation of this bacterial strain and this detergent in a purification-based industrial production scheme of commercial cholesterol oxidase.</p>         </sec>       </abstract>       <kwd-group>         <kwd>Cholesterol oxidase</kwd>         <kwd>           <italic>Rhodococcus erythropolis ATCC 25544</italic>         </kwd>         <kwd>enzyme purification</kwd>         <kwd>Triton X-114</kwd>         <kwd>phase separation</kwd>       </kwd-group>     </article-meta><chunk-body> <p xmlns="https://dtd.nlm.nih.gov/ns/archiving/2.3/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">In a previous work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] we described the cell-bound and extracellular cholesterol oxidase activities from <italic><span resource="#T1" typeof="d3o:Bacteria">R. erythropolis</span></italic> <span resource="#T2" typeof="d3o:Strain">ATCC 25544</span>, achieving in optimal conditions 55% cell-bound and 45% extracellular activity.

    </article-meta><chunk-body prefix="d3o: https://purl.dsmz.de/schema/"><p>Results from a typical batch fermentation are shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>. Three stages can be differentiated during the fermentation process, (i) A first stage (0–16 h), in which 02 consumption increases continuously and HCl is consumed to keep the pH constant to 6.75. Buckland et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] found that pH of the culture rose by 0.5 units in the first part of growth, and then fell. An exponential increase of cell mass is observed and low levels of COX activity appear linked to cells, (ii) The second stage (16–45 h) is characterized by a strong 02 consumption and a consumption of base. In this phase aerobic metabolism drives the cell growth but the growth rate is certainly limited by the O<sub>2</sub> availability – note pO<sub>2</sub> is nearly zero under continuous stirring and air supply-. This stage is also characterized by a high rate of COX production of both types, cell-linked and extracellular, (iii) The third stage (45 h to the end of the process) a second phase of consumption of acid was recorded whereas pO<sub>2</sub> increased again to reach saturating levels. The greatest increase of cell-linked COX production was observed in this stage whilst extracellular COX production stopped.</p>         <fig xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" position="float" id="F1">           <label>Figure 1</label>           <caption>             <p>Characterization of the <italic><span class="entity" resource="#T1" typeof="d3o:Bacteria">R. erythropolis</span></italic> fermentation process: biomass and production of cell-linked and extracellular COX.

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] but differed in the accumulation of extracellular COX: the strain of <span class="entity" resource="#T2" typeof="OOS">Nocardia</span> (<span class="entity" resource="#T3" typeof="d3o:Strain">NCIB 10554</span>) used by these authors produced very low levels of extracellular enzyme while the strain tested in this work produces high levels. They also tested the effect of dissolved oxygen tension on the production of COX and found that in limiting conditions of oxygen supply the production of cell-linked COX was low. As seen in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, when oxygen supply is limiting (in the second stage) the rate of cell-linked COX production decreases, however is in these conditions when extracellular COX production takes place. Thus, there seem to be some relation between dissolved oxygen tension and extracellular COX production by the strain used in this work.</p>         <p>The results obtained are coherent with those presented in a previous study in shaken flasks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], where extracellular COX production is large and arises from the partial solubilization of the cell-linked enzyme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. After 70 hours of fermentation the total enzyme activity obtained was ca. 360 U/ml, being 230 U/ml cell-linked and 130 U/ml extracellular, thus the cell-linked to extracellular ratio is 1.26. This ratio in shaken flasks ranged from 1.26, using the same amount of Tween 80 as in this work (0.1%), to 1.38, using 1% Tween 80, but in the latter the overall yields of COX production were 7-fold smaller [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. The overall yield obtained in this work is comparable to that obtained by Buckland et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] and by Minut et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] but larger than that of Cheetham et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Watanabe et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] compared the cell-linked and extracellular COX production of 31 strains of the genus <italic><span class="entity" resource="#T4" typeof="OOS">Rhodococcus</span></italic> and <italic><span class="entity" resource="#T2" typeof="OOS">Nocardia</span></italic> and found that among the best extracellular COX producers, the strains <span class="entity" resource="#T6" typeof="d3o:Bacteria"><italic>Rhodococcus</italic> sp</span>.

Their enzymatic properties strongly supported the idea that the particulate and the extracellular cholesterol oxidases are two different forms of the same enzyme with an estimated molecular mass of 55 kDa. In this work we optimize the culture conditions in a 2-liter fermentor of this extracellular <span class="entity" resource="#T1" typeof="d3o:Enzyme" id="5"><button class="entity" type="button" typeof="d3o:Enzyme" resource="#T1">cholesterol oxidase</button></span> producer strain and carry out the extraction, partial purification and concentration of both types of <span class="entity" resource="#T1" typeof="d3o:Enzyme" id="6"><button class="entity" type="button" typeof="d3o:Enzyme" resource="#T1">cholesterol oxidase</button></span> by using Triton X-114 phase separation. The results obtained are very promising for the use of this strain and this technique in the industrial processing of <span class="entity" resource="#T7" typeof="OOS" id="7">bacteria</span> to obtain <span class="entity" resource="#T1" typeof="d3o:Enzyme" id="8"><button class="entity" type="button" typeof="d3o:Enzyme" resource="#T1">cholesterol oxidase</button></span>.</p>                 <h3>Results and discussion</h3>                <h4>Batch cultivation of <span class="entity" resource="#T2" typeof="d3o:Bacteria" id="9"><button class="entity" type="button" typeof="d3o:Bacteria" resource="#T2">R. erythropolis</button></span> (<span class="entity" resource="#T10" typeof="d3o:Strain" id="10"><button class="entity" type="button" typeof="d3o:Strain" resource="#T10">ATCC 25544</button></span>)</h4>         <p>The <span class="entity" resource="#T7" typeof="OOS" id="11">bacteria</span> were grown on the GYS medium in a 2-liter scale fermentor in batch mode operation under pH and temperature controlled conditions. Under this conditions the cell yield was doubled (9.5 mg/ml vs. 4.8 mg/ml dry cell weight) and the cultivation time was reduced to one third (60 vs. 180 hours) as compared with shaken flasks. These results are in good agreement with the literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. We found that addition of 2 g/l cholesterol to the culture broth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], prepared as an aqueous <span class="entity" resource="#T12" typeof="d3o:Enzyme" id="12"><button class="entity" type="button" typeof="d3o:Enzyme" resource="#T12">emulsion</button></span> with the aid of Tween 80 at a weight ratio 2:1 results in a high yield of <span class="entity" typeof="d3o:Enzyme" resource="#T5" id="15">COX</span> production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], but the preparation procedure of that <span class="entity" resource="#T12" typeof="d3o:Enzyme" id="13"><button class="entity" type="button" typeof="d3o:Enzyme" resource="#T12">emulsion</button></span> had a marked influence in the final enzyme yield, although not on the cell weight, as seen in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>.
